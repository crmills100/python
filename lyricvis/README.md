# Caveats

I've only run this on a limited amount of hardware (client running on a Windows 10 host with Stable Diffusion running on a Windows 11 host with a RTX 30 series GPU). As a result, there are likely a few references
to directories that may not exist and are certainly not platform agnostic. If you fix these please send a patch.
